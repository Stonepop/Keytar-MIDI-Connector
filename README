Maps a Wii RockBand 3 Keyboard's USB dongle HID events to Mac OS X MIDI events.

Plug in the dongle before launching the application.

(The whole thing needs lots of work. But it does the job.)

This allows you to use your Wii RockBand 3 Keyboard with Garageband or
the marvelous Synthesia [ http://www.synthesiagame.com/ ].

Share and Enjoy!
